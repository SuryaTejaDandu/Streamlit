Maximize function

Objective 

Final Distribution with optimal function

## For WebApp:
Features of the Interface

User Inputs:
Dropdown for selecting a region.
Sliders for setting avocado price, year, and peak/non-peak season.
Optional: Include sliders for transport cost or custom supply allocation.

Prediction:
Use the trained regression model (reg) to predict units sold based on user inputs.
Display predicted units sold dynamically.

Optimization Results:
Display a table summarizing:
Optimal price, allocated supply, units sold, waste, and predicted demand.
Show the optimal net revenue achieved.

Interactive Visuals:
Bar graph comparing:
Predicted demand vs. actual allocation.
Revenue contributions by region
